Oues1 : What is JAVA?
Ans: It is created by James Gosling in the year 1995. And now it is owned by Oracle. It was developed by Sun Micorsystem.
It is high level programming language and based on the principles of object-oriented programming and can be used to develop large-scale applications. 
In java operator overloading and multiple inheritance is not supported.


Ques 2: Is java pure object oriented ?
Ans: Java supports primitive datatypes that are byte, int etc. which are not objects hence it is not called as pure object oriented programming language.
Reason:- Static methods
String
Primitive Wrapper classes
Procedural Programming language.


Ques 3: It Is platform-independent?
Ans: Yes because it is Compiled Once and can be Run Anywhere:
Java code is written in .java files, which are human-readable source code files.
When you compile a Java program using the Java Compiler (javac), it translates the code into an intermediate form known as bytecode, which is stored in .class files. This bytecode is not machine-specific; it is standardized and consistent across all platforms.

Java Virtual Machine (JVM):
The bytecode generated by the Java compiler is executed by the JVM. The JVM acts as an interpreter between the bytecode and the underlying hardware.
Different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.) have their own implementations of the JVM, but they all interpret the same bytecode in the same way, allowing Java programs to run on any system that has a compatible JVM.
The key point here is that the bytecode is independent of any particular operating system or hardware, making Java programs portable.

Summary:
Java is platform-independent because of its use of bytecode, which can be executed on any platform with a JVM. The JVM acts as the mediator between the platform-specific details and the uniform bytecode, allowing Java programs to run seamlessly across different environments. This design is what makes Java highly portable and versatile across different computing platforms.

Ques 4:What is JDK, JRE, JVM?
Ans: JDK: Java development Kit . It is software development kit that includes tools for developing and compiling Java applications.
JRE: JAVA Runtime Environment . It is runtime environment to execute Java applications.
JVM: Java Virtual Machine. It is a virtual machine responsible for running java bytecode on a specific platform.
